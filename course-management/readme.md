# Course Management API

Welcome to the Course Management API! This API allows you to manage students, courses, and enrollments for a university or educational platform. You can easily interact with students, courses, and enrollments via a set of RESTful endpoints.

## 🚀 Project Setup

### Requirements

Before you can run the project, make sure you have the following installed:

* **Java 11 or higher**
* **Maven** (or any Java build tool you prefer)
* **Spring Boot** (for automatic setup)
* **An IDE** (such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code)

### How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/course-management-api.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd course-management-api
   ```

3. **Build and run the project using Maven:**

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   Alternatively, if you prefer running a packaged JAR file:

   ```bash
   java -jar target/coursemanagement-api.jar
   ```

4. The application will start running on `http://localhost:8080`.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Java**: The primary programming language used for backend development.
* **Spring Boot**: Used for rapid development and setting up RESTful APIs.
* **JPA (Java Persistence API)**: Used to interact with a relational database (H2 for this project).
* **Maven**: Used for dependency management and project build.
* **Swagger UI** (Optional): For API documentation and testing (available at `/swagger-ui.html`).

---

## 🔄 Database Setup

This project uses **H2** in-memory database by default. You can use it for development purposes. For production, you can configure other databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

### Sample Data

The database is populated with sample data during application startup. You can modify the `data.sql` file for custom data seeding.

## 📑 OpenAPI Documentation

The API is documented using **Swagger UI**. To view the API documentation and test the endpoints interactively, visit:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
```

Swagger provides an easy way to test the endpoints directly from the browser.

---

## 🔄 Sample Data Initialization (Optional)

To initialize the database with some sample data on startup, add the following SQL into the `src/main/resources/data.sql` file:

```sql
-- Insert sample students
INSERT INTO students (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com');
INSERT INTO students (name, email) VALUES ('Alice Smith', 'alice.smith@example.com');

-- Insert sample courses
INSERT INTO courses (title, description, instructor) VALUES ('Java Programming', 'Learn Java from scratch.', 'Jane Smith');
INSERT INTO courses (title, description, instructor) VALUES ('Spring Boot Basics', 'Learn Spring Boot framework.', 'John Doe');
```
